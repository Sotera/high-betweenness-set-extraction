<h3><a name="benchmarks" class="anchor" href="#benchmarks"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span></a> Benchmarks and Trade Offs</h3>
<p>This method has 4 primary parameters that can greatly effect the run time and accuracy of the results. </p>
<ul>
    <li> Pivot batch size - number of single source shortest paths computed in parallel.
    </li>
    <li>
        Extracted set size - number of high betweenness nodes to return in the result set.
    </li>
    <li>
        Cutoff - threshold for membership change of the high betweenness set
    </li>
    <li>
        Counter - number of times the cutoff value is reached before the algorithm exits.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>To characterize the behavior of these parameters we've run a series of tests of 5 data sets.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Bitcoin transaction graph 2,132,321 vertices 25 days to calculate exact betweenness on a single core.
    </li>
    <li>
        Brightkite social network. 58,228 vertices, 18 minutes to calculate exact betweenness on a single core.
    </li>
    <li>
        Enron email data set. 35,818 vertices, 156 seconds to calculate exact betweenness on a single core.
    </li>
    <li>
        Gowalla social network. 196,591 vertices (not calculated on single core)
    </li>
    <li>
        Google Plus social network. 102,118 vertices, 14.5 hours to calculate exact betweenness on a single core.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>All tests below were run on an 8-node cluster using 8 giraph workers using 8 threads per worker.</p>
