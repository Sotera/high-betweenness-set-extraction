        Shortest paths are calculated from a set of pivots (source nodes) to all other nodes in the graph.
    </li>
    <li>
        The dependency of each vertex for each pivot is calculated and added to a running total approximated betweenness.
    </li>
    <li>
        The highest betweenness set is extracted.
    </li>
    <li>
        Set stability conditions are checked. If met algorithm exits, otherwise a new pivot batch is chosen and step 1 starts again.
