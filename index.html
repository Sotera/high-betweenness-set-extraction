<h3><a name="implementation" class="anchor" href="#implementation"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span></a> Implementation</h3>
<p>Our implementation is distributed using the BSP method on Apache giraph and built with Gradle. Giraph requires a Hadoop cluster (map
    reduce and hdfs)</p>

<h3><a name="io" class="anchor" href="#io"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span></a> I/O</h3>

<p>The graph is read from an edge list file in HDFS, each line in the file represents a single edge and is coded as a "key,target,weight"
    (edge weight is optional and defaults to 1)</p>
<p>
    Graph vertices must be coded to use integer ids ranging from 0,1,...N where N is number of vertices -1. So an example graph file could be <a
        href="https://github.com/Sotera/high-betweenness-set-extraction/blob/master/example/example.csv">this</a>.
</p>
<p>Output is a directory in HDFS with both the extracted high betweenness set and the approximate betweenness value for all nodes.</p>
